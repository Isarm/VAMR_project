# Project for Vision Algorithms and Computer Vision

## How to run:

Run the main file in `src/main.m`. Change datasets by changing the `ds` parameter.

To run the bundle adjustment version, check out the bundleAdjustment branch:  
`git checkout bundleAdjustment`

This was an initial implementation, that is not yet working correctly.
